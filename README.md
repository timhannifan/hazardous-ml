# hazardous-ml
Machine learning study to predict hazardous waste violations and prioritize EPA inspections

## Purpose
This project uses data from EPA inspections of hazardous waste facilities to predict likely future violators. The purpose of this study is to create a prioritized list of facilities for EPA inspection, in an effort to increase the effectiveness of the process and prevent significant environmental/human harm from the improper disposal and storage of toxic material.

Hazardous waste activity is regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and information is publicly available on inspections, violations, and enforcement actions [link](https://echo.epa.gov/tools/data-downloads/rcrainfo-download-summary#download_files). The dataset spans 1980 to present and contains approximately one million inspection records.
